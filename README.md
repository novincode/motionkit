## Why MotionKit?

Figma gives you complete control over design — but animation? You're stuck exporting frames, switching tools, or fighting prototype constraints.

**MotionKit brings a full animation timeline into Figma.** Keyframes, easing curves, frame-by-frame workflows, vector morphing, text animation, and direct video export — all without leaving your canvas.

---

## Features

### 🎬 Timeline Animation
A professional keyframe timeline inspired by Blender and After Effects. Drag-and-drop keyframes with snapping, visual easing curve editor, and work area markers for loop control. Animate 17+ properties — position, scale, rotation, opacity, blur, shadows, corner radius, stroke, fill, and more.

### 🎞️ Frame-by-Frame
Classic cel animation workflow. Create clips, scrub through frames, and use onion skinning to reference previous frames. Supports per-frame timing and independent frame rates.

### 🔀 Nested Animations
Timeline inside frame-by-frame. Frame-by-frame inside timeline. Each runs at its own frame rate. Rendered correctly, composited properly.

### 🌀 Vector Morphing
Animate between different vector shapes with real SVG path interpolation. Works with all editable path types — vectors, rectangles, ellipses, polygons, stars, booleans.

### ✍️ Text Animation
Per-character, per-segment text keyframing. Animate font size, color, letter spacing, line height, and more — across individual text ranges or the full node. A full text animation engine built for motion design.

### 🎥 Export
Render directly to **MP4** (H.264), **GIF**, or **PNG sequence** at any scale (1x–4x). No external tools required. Plus export to **Lottie JSON** or **MotionKit format** for cross-project reuse.

### ⏺️ Recording Mode
Move elements in Figma and keyframes appear automatically at the playhead. Fast iteration without clicking through menus.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts
Fully customizable shortcuts with Blender-inspired defaults. Copy, paste, nudge, select, and navigate entirely from the keyboard.

### 🔧 Anchor Points
Set custom anchor points per layer. All transforms — rotation, scale, position — animate relative to the anchor, just like After Effects.

### 📦 Import / Export Timelines
Save and load animations as MotionKit files. Share animation data between Figma files or with teammates.
