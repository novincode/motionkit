## Why MotionKit?

Figma gives you complete design control — but animation? You're stuck exporting frames, switching tools, rebuilding everything elsewhere.

**MotionKit brings a full animation timeline into Figma.** Keyframes, easing curves, frame-by-frame workflows, vector morphing, text animation, and direct video export — all without leaving your canvas.

No subscriptions. No paywalls. Just animation.

## Features

### 🎬 Timeline Animation
Professional keyframe timeline inspired by Blender and After Effects. Drag keyframes with snapping, visual easing curves, and work area markers. Animate 17+ properties — position, scale, rotation, opacity, blur, shadows, corner radius, stroke, fill, and more.

**Recording Mode**: Move elements in Figma and keyframes appear automatically at the playhead. No menus, no clicking — just animate.

### 🎞️ Frame-by-Frame
Classic cel animation workflow with onion skinning. Create clips, scrub frames, and reference previous frames as translucent overlays. Independent frame rates and per-frame timing.

### 🔀 Nested Animations
Timeline inside frame-by-frame. Frame-by-frame inside timeline. Each runs at its own FPS, rendered and composited correctly. This unlocks complex animation possibilities that weren't possible before.

### 🌀 Vector Morphing
Animate between different vector shapes with real SVG path interpolation. Works with vectors, rectangles, ellipses, polygons, stars, and boolean operations.

### ✍️ Text Animation
Per-character, per-segment text keyframing. Animate font size, color, letter spacing, line height across individual ranges or full nodes. A complete text animation engine for motion design.

### 🎥 Export
Render directly to **MP4** (H.264), **GIF**, or **PNG sequence** at any scale (1x–4x). Export to **Lottie JSON** or **MotionKit format** for cross-project reuse. No external tools required.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts
Fully customizable shortcuts with Blender-inspired defaults. Select keyframes and press **G** to move, **S** to scale. Copy, paste, nudge, select — entirely from keyboard.

### 🔧 Presets & More
- **Anchor Points**: Custom anchor points per layer for rotation and scaling
- **Preset Library**: Save and reuse animations, use built-in defaults
- **Snapping Tools**: Customizable snapping for precise keyframe placement
- **Import/Export Timelines**: Share animation data between files and teammates
