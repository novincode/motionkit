# MotionKit

**Real animation inside Figma. Frame-by-frame, timeline, morphing — no exports, no workarounds.**

Figma is incredible for design. But when it comes to motion? You're stuck exporting frames, jumping between tools, or fighting prototype limitations.

MotionKit changes that. Create actual animations — with keyframes, easing curves, and frame-by-frame control — right where you design.

## What You Get After Rendering

MotionKit exports a folder with:

- **PNG sequence** — numbered frames ready for import
- **manifest.json** — timing data, FPS, frame count
- **readme.txt** — quick instructions

Most video editors (DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, After Effects) accept PNG sequences directly. Just drag the folder in.

If MotionKit helps you, consider supporting development or spreading the word.
