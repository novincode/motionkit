          "body": "Keyframes are the foundation of animation in MotionKit. A keyframe captures the state of a property (position, rotation, opacity, scale) at a specific point in time.\n\nMotionKit interpolates between keyframes to create smooth animations automatically."

MotionKit captures the change at the current playhead position.\n- **Manual** — Right-click a layer row in the timeline and choose **Add Keyframe** to insert one at the playhead."

          "body": "By default keyframes interpolate smoothly. You can switch to **discrete** (step) interpolation for instant value changes — perfect for sprite-like toggling or visibility switches.\n\nRight-click a keyframe and choose **Toggle Discrete** to switch modes."
